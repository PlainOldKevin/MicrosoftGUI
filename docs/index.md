## Project Description

This project is a prototype GUI-based application for Microsoft. This application in essence automates the process of putting an existing project on a computer up to GitHub.

## Setup/Run Instructions

The user will need to have at least Java 8 installed on their computer, as well as an IDE to run the program. The graphical program "swing" is not needed to run the GUI. Two external libraries used are [GitSubProcessClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitSubprocessClient) v0.0.12 [(documentation)](https://csc109.github.io/GitSubprocessClient/) and [GitHubApiClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitHubApiClient) v0.0.7 [(documentation)](https://csc109.github.io/GitHubApiClient/) .
